### Hi there, I'm Alex aka gracikk ðŸ‘‹

### I'm working for EPAM Systems as a Data Scientist

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything, but especially computer vision concepts
- :two_men_holding_hands: I'm looking to collaborate with other DS specialists
- ðŸ”­ I've finished the Advanced CV EPAM course recently, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/gracikk-ds/cv-epam-course)!
- ðŸ¥… 2022 Goals: Just wanna get out of all this shit.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to do morning yoga and read fantasy books ðŸ˜Š

### Some My Projects
- [ML Engineering EPAM]() - repository where you can check out all work that I've been doing during my ml-ops course.
- [Basic Data Science EPAM](https://github.com/gracikk-ds/basic_ds_epam) Here you can see all my homework, which I was doing during the Basic Data Science EPAM course.
- [Computer Vision course EPAM](https://github.com/gracikk-ds/cv-epam-course) And here I store my homework, which I was doing during the Advanced CV EPAM course.
- [DeepLearningSchool](https://github.com/gracikk-ds/DeepLearningSchool) And here you can see all my homework, which I was doing during the Deep Learning School course.  
- [Detection project](https://github.com/gracikk-ds/detection) - the final project of the Deep Learning School. The current version of the repository allows you to test the quality of the YOLOv3 detector trained to detect knives and pistols. Also, you can see the screens of my simple demo
- [CourseWork in Finance](https://github.com/gracikk-ds/finance_course) is my very first project in the Data Science sphere. I was trying to test the hypothesis of an efficient market, and based on the conclusions, built an investment portfolio constructor. It really helps me to get a deeper understanding of things that I've learned from the [Yandex ML Course](https://yandex.ru/promo/academy/data_analysis)
- [YandexAlgorithm](https://github.com/gracikk-ds/Yandex.Algorithms) Recently I've joined Yandex.Algorithm training. I will keep my progress here.
